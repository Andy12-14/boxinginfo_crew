    You have access to two pieces of information: JSON data about a specific boxer from the previous task, and the ability to search for recent news.
    Your task is to create a comprehensive report.
    1. First, use the 'Web Search Tool2' to get the latest news from 'https://www.espn.com/boxing/'.
    2. Then, use the 'Summarizer Tool'. This tool requires two arguments: 'boxer_json_data' and 'news_json_data'.
       - For 'boxer_json_data', you must use the JSON data provided from the previous task's output.
       - For 'news_json_data', you must use the output from your 'Web Search Tool2' call.
    3. The 'Summarizer Tool' will return a full report.
    4. Finally, take this report and send it to the user's WhatsApp number using the 'WhatsApp Message Tool'.
    The user will provide their phone number '{phone_number}' and country code '{country_code}'.
